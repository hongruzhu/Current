## Features
### Multi-users Video Conference
Developed multi-users video conference with webcam and mic toggling by integrating **PeerJS (WebRTC library)** and **Socket.IO**.

### Background Changing
Achieved real-time background changing by extracting the person's image from the webcam using **MediaPipe** and utilizing the **Canvas API** for layered rendering and animation.

### Collaborative Whiteboard
Created a collaborative whiteboard with **Canvas API** and **Socket.IO**, effectively managing race conditions with a **queue**.

## Appendix: How does WebRTC work to realize a P2P connection?

![Êà™Âúñ 2023-05-26 ‰∏ãÂçà7 58 50](https://github.com/hongruzhu/Current/assets/121448431/f9a67865-d4b1-4ae7-8c8e-26a2f0ec6312)

**Step 1 & 2:** 

User A and B exchange their Session Description Protocol (SDP) through a Signaling Server. Each user creates their own SDP, which contains information about their media streams, such as audio and video.

**What's Session Description Protocol (SDP)?**
* SDP contains detailed information about media streams, such as audio and video, including encoding formats, transport protocols, and port numbers. It describes the parameters required to establish a connection between two peers.
* The purpose of exchanging SDPs through the Signaling Server is to enable the peers to mutually confirm each other's media requirements and capabilities, in order to establish a suitable connection.
* During the SDP exchange, the peers can also negotiate, for example, to choose the most appropriate encoding format and transport protocol, ensuring smooth communication.

**Step 3:**

User A and B individually collect Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidates. This involves obtaining their public IP address and port from a Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) server and acquiring relay IP address and port from a Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server when STUN fails to perform NAT traversal.

**Step 4 & 5:** 

User A and B exchange their ICE candidates through the Signaling Server.

**Step 6:**

The optimal candidates for establishing a connection are selected from the exchanged ICE candidates. The connection is established using UDP. If STUN-based NAT traversal fails, the connection resorts to using TURN relay, although this is no longer considered a true P2P connection.

Once the connection is successfully established, User A and B can commence data transmission to each other. ü•≥
